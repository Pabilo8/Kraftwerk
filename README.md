# Kraftwerk
### A modelling and animation toolkit for Minecraft Modders.
Kraftwerk is a 3D modelling tool created with intention to be a tool primarily for Minecraft Modders.  
It is meant to be a spiritual successor to SMP Toolbox 2.0, a great and functionally superior tool, which combined a simple model creation method while allowing shapes more advanced than cubes (and by that more complex models).  
The design is highly influenced by IntelliJ IDEA in both concept and looks (that was made possible by the [DarkLaf](https://github.com/weisJ/darklaf) library).  
Rendering is done in OpenGL, thanks to the [JogAmp](https://jogamp.org/) library.

### Installation
To install the software, download [the latest](https://github.com/Pabilo8/kraftwerk/releases/latest) release from the "Releases" section on GitHub.  
Java 8 and a graphics card with OpenGL 4.x support are required.
